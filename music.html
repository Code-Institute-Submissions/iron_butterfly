                                    <p>Though it was not recorded until their second album, "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" was written 
                                    during Iron Butterfly's early days. According to drummer Ron Bushy, organist/vocalist Doug Ingle 
                                    wrote the song one evening while drinking an entire gallon of Red Mountain wine. 
                                    When the inebriated Ingle then played the song for Bushy, who wrote down the lyrics for him, 
                                    he was slurring his words so badly that what was supposed to be "in the Garden of Eden" was 
                                    interpreted by Bushy as "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida".  Even though nearly all of Iron Butterfly's songs 
                                    were quite structured, the idea of turning the minute-and-a-half long ballad into an 
                                    extended jam emerged very early; Jeff Beck claims that when he saw Iron Butterfly perform 
                                    at the Galaxy Club in April 1967, half a year before the band recorded their first album, 
                                    their entire second set consisted of a 35-minute long version of "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.

                            The album was a huge seller for Atlantic Records. It was released on the ATCO  Label which was 
                            a division of Atlantic Records. For the younger generation who may not be familiar with 
                            Atlantic Records, the label was also the home of Led Zeppelin,  The Rolling Stones, 
                            Alice Cooper, Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Velvet Underground, and so many more bands of the 
                            classic rock era.</p>

                            <p>Iron Butterfly debut album was a powerhouse rock and roll record. The album Heavy has 
                            long been one of my favorite Iron Butterfly records. Coming in at No 4. on the Top 5 Iron Butterfly 
                            songs list is the album’s third track on side two entitled “Fields of Sun.” Not to be confused 
                            with Sting’s “Fields of Gold,” but I wonder if Sting got the idea for his song from this track.</p>

                            <p>Metamorphosis is the fourth studio album by Iron Butterfly, released on August 13, 1970. Though not as 
                            successful as its predecessor Ball (1969), it reached number 16 on the US charts. Erik Brann, who left 
                            because of band disputes, was replaced by four session guitarists. Two of them, Mike Pinera and 
                            Larry "Rhino" Reinhardt (called El Rhino on the sleeve), would become members of Iron Butterfly 
                            before the album's release. Officially, the album is credited not to Iron Butterfly, but to 
                            "Iron Butterfly with Pinera & Rhino", in reference to the two aforementioned guitarists.
                            The album spawned the single "Easy Rider (Let the Wind Pay the Way)", which reached number 66 on the 
                            Billboard chart, making it the band's biggest hit aside from "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida". The album is noted 
                            for having one of the earliest uses of the talk box on a rock album.</p>

                        The Los Angeles music climate of the late sixties and seventies was characterized by the heavy
                        sounds and sentiments that reflected the revolutionary attitudes of the generation.  Bursting
                        onto the scene was Iron Butterfly, whose sound not only epitomized the hard attitudes of the 
                        youth with its heavy drumming and bass lines, but also embraced more delicate aspirations
                        through its intricate guitar and keyboard overlays.
