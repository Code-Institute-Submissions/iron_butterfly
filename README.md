  Project Iron Butterfly
  
  This project is showcasing a 60's rock band who in their day was one of the most influential progressive rock bands to come out of the USA.  
  Much more than your average "one hit wonder," Iron Butterfly, in many ways, epitomized late '60s hard rock, specifically the moment where 
  psychedelia spawned the somewhat media driven, somewhat accurate, and somewhat silly moniker of "acid rock.
  
  I hope to show you the history of the band members (some who has sadly passed away), new band members who have embraced the Iron Butterfly music style, 
  some of their classic tracks from multi-platinum albums.  It will be delight to people who know their music and hopefully give inspiration to the next
  generation.
  
  With regards to the UX - user experience, if users were in their teens when Iron Butterfly came on the scene back in the 60's, the users are going to be in their 
  late 60's or early 70's and maybe they might be a bit unsure how to get information from the website.  This is where the website is designed to be
  as user friendly as possible - crisp and clean, easy to see navigational buttons, not cluttered but having the correct information which is easy to spot
  and access.  Also the different elements of the site which will be accessed will not take the user from the main page, ie no new tabs will be open and therefore
  the user will not get lost or have to use the back button.
  
  The design of the website utilizes HTML5 with bootstrap and additional CSS and fontawesome but the initial creation of the website was done using pen and paper to give a storyboard
  feel to the site.  The usage of fontsawesome which was demonstrated in a previous tutorial was implemented as it gave the website a more professional feel.
  
  The site is split into 4 separate features: The home page for example introduces the current band members and each one has a little write up and picture.  
  It also has a history section just to give the users a little bit of information.
  
  The music page has 5 tracks each with their own audio player and a short write up of the track.  The audio player is HTML5 with CSS styling (no Javascript used as
  I have not done the module as yet), the transitions and animations for the audio player I found freely available and designed by other coders which suited the 
  style of the webpage.  I have also added a timeline to give the user again more information about the initial album right through to some of the latest ones.
  
  The tour dates page has only one entry as the band are not touring at the moment but it does showcase where in the USA they last played and for what reason.
  
  The contact page is basically a form which a user could contact the band to place a booking.  This form is not active as I am not at that point in the course to
  enable the form to work.  But it does demonstrate in a very simplistic way how a user can contact the band for bookings.
  
  The website has been designed for mobile first approach and it has been checked using the responsive settings in Chrome.  The HTML and CSS3 has been analysed using 
  a validation service.
  
  The website has been finally committed to GitHUb, it has been updated as every webpage was completed.
  
  I also took the opportunity and spoke to Mike Green (percussionist of the band) to confirm if I could use any of the images of the band, ensuring him and all
  band members that this is just a project and it will not be available to the general public.
  
  I also confirmed that the design of my website would and is totally different from their existing one - this proves a unique design and no copyright should
  be infringed.
  
  The audio tracks used are my own tracks which I purchased but again due to copyright they cannot be used on this website if it was to go public.
  
  I have tried to encapsulate all the lessons learned through the Code Institute and the basis of the website design should encapsulate the clean and straightforward
  design which the users will appreciate

  Make some changes to the file, save, watch the preview, and have fun!

Happy coding!
