  Project Iron Butterfly
  
  This is my first milestone project which has incorporated HTML5 and CSS from the first two modules of the course.
  
  This project is showcasing a 60's rock band who in their day was one of the most influential progressive rock bands to come out of the USA.  
  Much more than your average "one hit wonder," Iron Butterfly, in many ways, epitomized late '60s hard rock, specifically the moment where 
  psychedelia spawned the somewhat media driven, somewhat accurate, and somewhat silly moniker of "acid rock.
  
  TABLE OF CONTENTS
  
    UX
    
        The initial design of the website was done using pen & paper - the design was not stored electronically but apart from a few enhancements, I have
        stuck rigid to the initial design.
        
        This website is a simple 4 page site primarly designed to be as user friendly as possible.  
        It has easy to see and click navigational buttons which will take the user to a new page on the website.  There are no external pages where a user 
        might get lost.  But primarly the site is designed to give the user information (either historical, factural, visual, audible) in an uncomplicated
        manner.
        
        As this band was formed in the 60's many users maybe classed as 'Silver Surfers', this is the primary target audience and therefore as the designer
        I have taken this into consideration.
        
        It has a bootstrap framework set up incorporating fontawesome, CSS stylesheets and cloudflare for the hover butttons.  FLexbox was not used as I am 
        not familier with its use.
        
        All social media links are not active (even though they are highlighted when hovered).  The previous modules did not include the processes or coding
        required for the links to work.
        
    FEATURES
    
        Home Page
        
          This page gives the user all of the band information from current members (pictures and a short bio) also a timeline of events for the intial years.
          
        Music
        
          This page gives the user a tasting session of 5 tracks by the band (again including a write up of each track) but also a discography of albums 
          released by the band.
          
        Tour Dates
        
          This page gives the user information relating to the last gig the band played at.  They are not touring at the moment so it is limited but there
          is a fans video showcasing the band playing live at a previous gig.
          
        Contact
        
          This page gives the user an opportunity to submit a form to the band.  Although, all the fields can be filled out, there is no link to the band
          as I have not received the training to allow this to happen.  But the form itself is again user friendly.
          
        Header
        
          The header which is displayed on every page has a really stylish logo and also the band name and their highest award they have received through album
          sales.
          
        Footer
        
          The fotter which is displayed on every page has more information of the band, more details of their awards and the required social links.  These
          links highlight when hovered over but as previously mentioned, they are inactive and do not link to any external sites.
          
    FEATURES LEFT TO IMPLEMENT
    
        Would of liked to have links to an online band shop where users could purchase mechandise, T shirts, caps etc, have a Point of Sale (POS) but
        it would be outside of the projects remit.
        
    TECHNOLOGIES USED
    
        The framework used was bootstrap (see link https://getbootstrap.com/) which also gave me the CSS stylesheets that was required. These gave me the structure
        that I required.Also I was impressed by one of the tutorials demonstrating different fonts and therefore I included fontawesome (see link https://fontawesome.com/). 
        For all the hover tricks I went to https://cdnjs.com/.  All the technologies used was encouraged by various tutors in the modules and using their
        knowledge and experience it was very useful.  Not only he usefulness but also an understanding a new coder needs to learn and implement with confidence.
        
    TESTING
    
        Using Chrome as my browser I used its tools to check the responsiveness of the website through various screen sizes.  I had already put @mediaquery in
        the CSS stylesheets and checked each page individually.  They all respond correctly even though I can spot whitespace at certain screen sizes.  All hover
        buttons work, audio files play and also the video file plays.  The form in the contact page can be accessed in any screen size and notifications are 
        present when you place the mouse pointer over each individual form box.
        
        I have run the CSS through a validation site (see link https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) 
        <p>
        <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer">
        <img style="border:0;width:88px;height:31px"
            src="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss"
            alt="Valid CSS!" />
        </a>

    DEPLOYMENT
    
        As the website was being built and also down to personal work issues (full time employed, high level of overtime), commits were spread out
        over time.  Therefore, heavy and long coding work was carried out when not working and then commits were made.  GitHUb is up to dates
        and has been viewed by my mentor.
