  Project Iron Butterfly
  
  This project is showcasing a 60's rock band who in their day was one of the most influential progressive rock bands to come out of the USA.  
  Much more than your average "one hit wonder," Iron Butterfly, in many ways, epitomized late '60s hard rock, specifically the moment where 
  psychedelia spawned the somewhat media driven, somewhat accurate, and somewhat silly moniker of "acid rock.
  
  I hope to show you the history of the band members (some who has sadly passed away), new band members who have embraced the Iron Butterfly music style, 
  some of their classic tracks from multi-platinum albums.  It will be delight to people who know their music and hopefully give inspiration to the next
  generation.
  
  With regards to the UX - user experience, if users were in their teens when Iron Butterfly came on the scene back in the 60's, the users are going to be in their 
  late 60's or early 70's and maybe they might be a bit unsure how to get information from the website.  This is where the website will be designed to be
  as user friendly as possible - crisp and clean, easy to see navigational buttons, not cluttered but having the correct information which is easy to spot
  and access.  Also the different elements of the site which will be accessed will not take the user from the main page, ie no new tabs will be open and therefore
  the user will not get lost or have to use the back button.
  
  The design of the website is using HTML5 with bootstrap and additional CSS but the initial creation of the website was done using pen and paper to give a storyboard
  feel to the site.  The usage of fontsawesome which was demonstrated in a previous tutorial was implemented as it gave the website a more professional feel.

3) Make some changes to the file, save, watch the preview, and have fun!

Happy coding!
